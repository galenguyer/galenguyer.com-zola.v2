<h2>Contact Me!</h2>
<hr />
<p>The best place to contact me is over email at <a href="mailto:galen@galenguyer.com">galen@galenguyer.com</a>. You can
    also use <a href="mailto:galenguyer@outlook.com">galenguyer@outlook.com</a>, but this one gets more spam so I check
    it less often.</p>
<p>If you wanna make me cry by using an overabundance of security, you can find my GPG key at <a
        href="https://gpg.galenguyer.com">gpg.galenguyer.com</a>. I'm also on <a
        href="https://keybase.io/galenguyer">keybase as galenguyer</a>, if you'd like to verify my identity on other
    platforms.</p>
<p>I'm also reachable on <a href="https://discord.com">Discord</a> as chef#1911.</p>
